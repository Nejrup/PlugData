[bl.imp2~] is a two sided impulse oscillator like [else/imp2~], but it is bandlimited with the upsampling/filtering technique. This makes the object quite inefficient CPU wise, but is an easy way to implement a bandlimited oscillator. 

TODO: Because this is an abstraction and Pd is still limited in the way it handles it, this object does not have any arguments.
