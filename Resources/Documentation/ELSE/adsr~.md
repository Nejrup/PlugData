[adsr~] is an attack/decay/sustain/release gated envelope. At gate on (transition from 0 to any value), the attack ramp is generated, then a decay ramp goes to the sustain point (specified as a ratio of the gate value). At gate off (transition from any value to 0), [adsr~] goes to 0 at the specified release time in ms.
